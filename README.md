### Description
This software is built with multiple variables, a scanner and a 2 dimensional string. The idea of the game is to risk your way without becoming too risky and eventually failing. The higher risk you choose the higher points you get but the faster you can die. The lower risk you choose, the longer it takes to get the end of the game. There are 20 questions dealing with different scenarios that one may face, you are able to choose whichever action you would like, but remember, this is a risk and reward game.
